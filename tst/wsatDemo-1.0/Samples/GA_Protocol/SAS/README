1. generate the promela file, type the following command:

	java wsat -GA SAS.spec -a


2. add the LTL property
	
	cat output.pml property.pml >! test.pml

3. generate the c code

	spin -a test.pml

4. compile the c code

	gcc -o pan pan.c

5. MODEL CHECKING!

	./pan -a

6. Analysis of error-trace

	spin -tlg test.pml

	You will the reginfo.requestlist.stockID is 0,1,0
	This leads to the error, because the second stockID, i.e., 1 is not sent

	type: spin -t -p -l -g test.pml >! trace.txt
	grep "msg =" trace.txt

	you will see a list of message assignments command, which shows the
    control flow.  Only one "request" was sent, and then the error trace
    goes directly to send "bill", because the first and the third element
    of regInfo.requestlist.stockID are the SAME!

	ISSTA'04 paper has the the detail explanation.
